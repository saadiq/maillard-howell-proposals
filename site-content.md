## Issue Section

**Title:** New York Moves — But Not Equally

**Subhead:** When you walk through New York City, you feel possibility everywhere but you also see the gaps.

### Problems (Accordion Items):

1. **School PE and student movement are shrinking every year.**
   Physical education time has steadily decreased across many NYC schools, leaving students with fewer opportunities to move, play, and build lifelong healthy habits. The inequity is most visible in low-income districts where staffing, equipment, and facility access are limited.

2. **Youth sports are increasingly privatized and out of reach.**
   As community leagues shrink and private clubs expand, thousands of kids, especially in underserved neighborhoods, are priced out of structured sport. Access now depends more on income than interest or talent, leaving many youth without safe, consistent ways to become and stay active.

3. **Seniors are trying to stay mobile with very little help.**
   New York's older adults face barriers ranging from unsafe sidewalks to limited strength and balance programming. Many want to stay active but lack the structured support needed to maintain mobility, independence, and social connection.

4. **Fitness options for New Yorkers living with disabilities are still extremely limited.**
   Adaptive programs, accessible facilities, and trained staff remain unevenly distributed across the city. Too many New Yorkers with disabilities encounter physical, logistical, and cultural barriers that prevent full participation in movement, recreation, and sport.

## Core Message Section

**Title:** Movement as a Right, Not a Privilege

**Statement:** My mission is to help build a coordinated movement ecosystem where every New Yorker, in every borough, at every age, of every ability has access to safe, meaningful, culturally relevant opportunities to move.

## Solution Section

### A Citywide Movement Framework — Beyond the Silos

Sports and recreation are often viewed as "nice to have," but they are among NYC's strongest tools for improving public health, mental wellbeing, school outcomes, work force performance and community safety.

**The Problem:**
NYC's movement system is fragmented. Agencies, schools, facilities, community groups, and nonprofits all work hard, but they operate separately. The issue isn't talent or effort. It's misalignment.

**The Opportunity:**
My vision unifies these pieces into a coordinated, citywide movement ecosystem that serves every New Yorker with clarity, consistency, and access. (Full framework in the NYC Sports, Wellness and Recreation Strategy Deck.)

### Three Concise Strategic Clusters

1. **Access & Equity**
   Ensuring every New Yorker across every borough, age, income level, and ability has real opportunities to move.

2. **Community Infrastructure**
   Modernizing and activating the parks, facilities, and public spaces that shape our daily lives.

3. **Lifelong Performance & Longevity**
   Movement pathways through every stage of life from youth play to adult recreation to aging well.
